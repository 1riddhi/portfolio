            Sentiment analysis is the process of computationally identifying and categorising opinions expressed in a piece of text, particularly in order to decide whether the writer has a positive, negative, or neutral attitude toward a particular subject, product, etc.

            This will be in the form of pictorial representation which will be in bar chart or pie chart. We will be using a pre-defined dataset and it will be filtered means we will be removing the extraneous things which are unnecessary like removal of numerical digits, links and user name to keep it anonymous which will train the model and then we will be testing the reviews that were posted by the users on the twitter. And lastly the conclusion will be drawn on the basis of it.

          <li>I had used python as a development/base programming tool. Moreover, I used Pandas, Scikit learn (sklearn), Matplotlib and seaborn. Initially, it read the comma separated value file with the help of Pandas library and then I’ll use Scikit Learn to split the data into training and testing and to train the model. Eventually, I had used Matplotlib and Seaborn to visualize the data. The task that we have done with the frameworks are
           <ol>
               <li>Classification: This is a classification application which will be having different categories where categories will be static and will be specified preliminary with the help of our dataset. For an instance “This is bad day” is negative and “what a great day” will be positive. 
                <li>Training: Some Columns or features from the data will be given to learn as our model will be supervised learning where we are training the model with adequate amount of data. This will be the words that are separated and will be 0 or 1 in Boolean values. </li>
                 <li> Prediction: The machine will see the features passed to the model and will decide the output as per the trained model</li>
